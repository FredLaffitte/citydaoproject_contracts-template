# CityDAO's Contract Template

> CityDAO wasn't built in a day. Use this smart contract developers environment as a scaffold and save yourself a bunch of hours.  **If you are interested in updating or changing this template, follow the _contributors guide_ below.**

**Status:** 

This project is still active and can be improved if you come up with acceptable suggestions/requests. See [Update & Educate](https://app.dework.xyz/citydao/engineering-2?taskId=404dd32b-f67e-4490-a534-b72f5a534517).
